acute myeloid leukemias ( aml ) , stratified into different risk categories based on cytogenetic and biomolecular analysis , respond differently to therapeutic interventions implemented for curative intent . 
 overall , most aml patients have complete remission but 40% commonly relapse during the first three years . 
 it occurs most often in the bone marrow ( bm ) but central nervous system ( cns ) involvement is not rare as its incidence ranges between 2% and 9% . 
 cns leukemia can present as meningeal leukemia , cranial nerve palsies or cerebral mesenchymal myeloid sarcoma . 
 peripheral neuropathy may also be a puzzling manifestation as it is a common complaint in clinical practice with a very wide differential diagnosis . 
 we report the case of an otherwise healthy 69 year - old female patient that presented to our department for a new onset of persistent disabling fatigue and 10% weight loss over two months . 
 she had no prior medical problems and did not

central nervous system ( cns ) relapse is not a rare presentation in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) as its incidence ranges between 2% and 9% . 
 it manifests with meningeal leukemia , cranial nerve palsies or cerebral mesenchymal myeloid sarcoma . 
 we herein report the case of a 69 year - old female that presented a pseudo - guillain  barr syndrome masking an aml cns relapse . 
 her symptoms completely resolved upon administration of a tailored treatment . 
 this case suggests that puzzling neurological manifestations in patients with a history of aml should be considered as a cns recurrence and investigated accordingly even in the context of normal imaging findings .

a supernumerary tooth is a development anomaly of number characterized by the presence of tooth in addition to the normal series . 
 its prevalence rates of reported in the literature vary between 0.1% and 3.6% in the permanent dentition depending on the respective population . 
 supernumerary teeth can occur as singles , multiples , unilaterally , or bilaterally and in the maxilla , the mandible , or both . according to alberti , 
 only 25% of all mesiodentes spontaneously erupt into the oral cavity . in general , they remain impacted and asymptomatic ; and are commonly discovered during the routine radiographic examination . 
 there are several hypotheses which have been proposed to explain the occurrence of supernumerary teeth , and their etiology remains unclear . a combination of environmental and genetic factors has been proposed to explain supernumerary tooth occurrence 
 . a range of complications varying from crowding to cyst formation can be caused by supernumerary tooth . 
 several studies have applied cone - beam computed tomography ( cbct ) to accurately diagnose supernumerary teeth with

supernumerary teeth are extra teeth or toothlike structures which may have either erupted or unerupted in addition to the 20 deciduous teeth and the 32 permanent teeth . 
 mesiodens is one of these located in the midline between the two central incisors . 
 their presence may give rise to a variety of clinical problems . 
 this paper describes a rare case of palatal placed , inverted and impacted mesiodens associated to two supernumerary teeth which were detected during a radiographic examination for delayed eruption of permanent central incisors in the case of a healthy 8-year - old girl monitored at the oral surgery service while discussing the usefulness of cone beam computed tomography for accurate diagnosis and management .

this paper attempts to clarify the nature of chemical sensitivity by proposing a theory of disease that unites the disparate clinical observations associated with the condition . 
 sensitivity to chemicals appears to be the consequence of a two - step process : loss of tolerance in susceptible persons following exposure to various toxicants , and subsequent triggering of symptoms by extremely small quantities of previously tolerated chemicals , drugs , foods , and food and drug combinations including caffeine and alcohol . 
 although chemical sensitivity may be the consequence of this process , a term that may more clearly describe the observed process is toxicant - induced loss of tolerance . 
 features of this yet - to - be - proven mechanism or theory of disease that affect the design of human exposure studies include the stimulatory and withdrawallike nature ( resembling addiction ) of symptoms reported by patients and masking . masking , which may blunt or eliminate responses to chemical challenges , appears to have several components : apposition , which is the overlapping of the effects of closely timed exposures , acclimatization or habituation , and addiction .

selective laser trabeculoplasty ( slt ) works just as well in iop - lowering as anti - glaucoma medication and argon laser trabeculoplasty ( alt ) but only utilizing 1% of the energy in alt hence making it a safer treatment for open angle glaucoma . while slt is safe and almost free of permanent damages to the trabecular meshwork and cornea , not everyone that is being treated responds . 
 recently , in a series of 83 eyes , slt was found to be effective in normal tension glaucoma ( ntg ) , lowering the iop by an additional 20% from pre - slt levels with 27% less medication use at 6 months while maintaining a 30% reduction from baseline iop . 
 much work has been done to identify the factors that predict slt success including : an absence of iop - lowering medication prior to laser and a higher pre - slt iop . 
 conflicting results have been reported for angle pigmentation , while other factors like diabetes , central corneal

abstractto determine the predictors of success for selective laser trabeculoplasty ( slt ) in normal tension glaucoma ( ntg).this prospective cohort study recruited subjects with unilateral or bilateral ntg on medication . 
 all subjects received a single session of 360 slt treatment . 
 slt success was defined as iop reduction 20% at 1-month . 
 the following covariates were analyzed via univariate and multivariate analyses : age ; sex ; lens status ; presenting , pre - slt , and post - slt iop 's ; number and type of medications ; slt shots and energy ; and pre - slt investigations.in 60 eyes of 32 subjects with ntg , there were 30 right eyes and 28 left eyes . 
 the success rate of slt was 61.7% . using 3 types of anti - glaucoma medications ( coefficient  =  2.2 , or  =  0.1 , 
 p  =  0.02

it is composed of cement and other cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag cement , aggregates     ( e.g. , gravels , crushed rock , and sand ) , water , and chemical admixture . 
 200  kg  cm ) , as the aggregates efficiently carry the compressive load . however , it is weak in its resistance to tension . 
 reinforced concrete is made by adding steel bars , steel fibers , glass fibers , or plastic fibers to concrete , in order to improve its tensile strength . 
 admixtures are materials that are added to give certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes 
 . they may help speed up or slow down the hydration of concrete and improve durability of concrete and plasticity or workability of fresh concrete . 
 since many reactions occur in concrete , some reactions are not desirable , especially the alkali - silica reaction ( asr ) . 
 asr is the neutralization reaction between alkaline cement paste and reactive noncrystalline ( amorphous ) silica , which is found in many common aggregates .

a simple flow injection with flame photometric detection has been developed for determination of sodium , potassium , and total alkalies in portland cement , fly ash , admixtures , and water of concrete . a liquid sample or a digest of solid sample 
 was injected into a water carrier stream which flowed to a flame photometer . a change in emission intensity at a selected wavelength 
 was recorded as a peak . 
 an amplifier circuit was fabricated , which helped improve sensitivity of the flame photometer . 
 calibration graphs in the range of 0.051.0  mg  l1 and 1.020.0  mg  l1 were obtained with a detection limit of 0.02  mg  l1 , for both potassium and sodium determination . 
 relative standard deviations for 11 replicates of injecting of 10  mg  l1 potassium and sodium solutions were 1.69 and 1.79% , respectively . 
 sample throughput of 120  h1 was achieved .
