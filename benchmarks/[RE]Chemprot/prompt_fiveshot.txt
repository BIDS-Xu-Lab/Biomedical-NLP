TASK: the task is to classify relations between a chemical and a gene for a sentence. 

INPUT: the input is a sentence where the chemical is labeled as @CHEMICAL$ and the gene is labeled as @GENE$ accordingly in a sentence. 

OUTPUT: your task is to select one out of the six types of relations ('CPR:3', 'CPR:4', 'CPR:5', 'CPR:6', 'CPR:9', and 'false') for the gene and chemical without any explanation or other characters:

CPR:3, which includes UPREGULATOR, ACTIVATOR, and INDIRECT UPREGULATOR

CPR:4, which includes DOWNREGULATOR, INHIBITOR ,and INDIRECT DOWNREGULATOR

CPR:5, which includes AGONIST, AGONIST ACTIVATOR, and AGONIST INHIBITOR

CPR:6, which includes ANTAGONIST

CPR:9, which includes SUBSTRATE, PRODUCT OF and SUBSTRATE PRODUCT OF

false, which indicates no relations

The following examples are provided:

Example-1 Q: [Pharmacological effects of a @CHEMICAL$ antagonist @GENE$ on alcohol dependence].

A: CPR:6

Example-2 Q: [Pharmacological effects of a @CHEMICAL$ antagonist naltrexone on @GENE$ dependence].

A: false

Example-3 Q: @CHEMICAL$, an @GENE$ antagonist, inhibits the positive inotropic effect but not the accumulation of inositol phosphates in rabbit heart.

A: CPR:6

Example-4 Q: @CHEMICAL$ effects on osteoblast viability, oleic acid uptake, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin production are independent of their effects on @GENE$.

A: CPR:4

Example-5 Q: @CHEMICAL$ and astemizole are chemically unrelated to @GENE$ antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine.

A: CPR:6

Q: {Input}
