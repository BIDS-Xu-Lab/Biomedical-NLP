INPUT: Are income-related differences in active travel associated with physical environmental characteristics? Rates of active travel vary by socio-economic position  with higher rates generally observed among less affluent populations. Aspects of both social and built environments have been shown to affect active travel  but little research has explored the influence of physical environmental characteristics  and less has examined whether physical environment affects socio-economic inequality in active travel. This study explored income-related differences in active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics including air pollution  climate and levels of green space  in urban areas across England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely to choose active transport as a means of travel.  Adults aged 16+ living in urban areas (n\u2009=\u200920 146) were selected from the 2002 and 2003 waves of the UK National Travel Survey. The mode of all short non-recreational trips undertaken by the sample was identified (n\u2009=\u2009205 673). Three-level binary logistic regression models were used to explore how associations between the trip being active (by bike/walking) and three income groups  varied by level of multiple physical environmental deprivation.  Likelihood of making an active trip among the lowest income group appeared unaffected by physical environmental deprivation; 15.4% of their non-recreational trips were active in both the least and most environmentally-deprived areas. The income-related gradient in making active trips remained steep in the least environmentally-deprived areas because those in the highest income groups were markedly less likely to choose active travel when physical environment was good  compared to those on the lowest incomes (OR\u2009=\u20090.44  95% CI\u2009=\u20090.22 to 0.89).
OUTPUT: no

INPUT: Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans? There is a positive association between chronic inflammation and the risk of cardiovascular disease  but whether there is an association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and carotid atherosclerosis is controversial. We investigated the relationship between high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in healthy Koreans.  We measured hsCRP levels  the carotid IMT  and conventional cardiovascular risk factors including obesity parameters  blood pressure  lipid profiles  insulin resistance  and smoking habits in 820 volunteers (35-79 years old) in a cross-sectional study.  Higher hsCRP quartile groups had higher mean IMTs  as compared with the lowest quartile (P<0.001 for the trend across quartiles). However  after adjustment for age  the relationship between hsCRP level and IMT was substantially weaker (P = 0.018). After additional adjustments for conventional cardiovascular risk factors  no significant association was observed (P = 0.548). The unadjusted risk for a high carotid IMT value (>or = 1.0 mm) was also positively related to hsCRP quartile  but this relationship was not significant after adjustment for age and other cardiovascular risk factors.
OUTPUT: no

INPUT: Are Reviewers' Scores Influenced by Citations to Their Own Work? Academic medical researchers are judged by how often their publications are cited in the literature. When serving as journal reviewers  they may be more favorably disposed to manuscripts that cite their work. We investigate whether manuscripts that contain a citation to the reviewers work receive higher evaluations than those that do not and\xa0whether peer reviewers encourage authors to cite that reviewers work.  We analyzed all research manuscripts submitted in 2012 to Annals of Emergency Medicine to determine whether they contained citations to each reviewers work. To determine whether citation affected reviewer scores  we obtained each reviewers score of the manuscripts overall desirability (1=worst to 5=best) and used descriptive statistics and regression modeling to compare scores of cited and noncited reviewers. We also enumerated how often reviewers suggested that authors add citations to the reviewers work or other work.  There were 395 manuscripts and 999 corresponding reviews with an manuscript desirability score. The 83 reviews by cited reviewers (8.3%) had a mean score of 2.8 (SD 1.4); the 916 reviews by noncited reviewers (91.7%)  2.5 (1.2; Δ=0.3; 95% confidence interval CI 0 to 0.6). The mean score in the 117 reviews of the noncited reviewers of\xa0the\xa057\xa0manuscripts that had both cited and noncited reviewers was 2.9 (SD 1.2) compared with 2.9 (SD 1.1) for the 68 reviews by cited reviewers (Δ=0; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.4). In the final ordinal regression model  the unadjusted OR for\xa0the manuscript desirability score was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.7); when adjusting for the manuscripts mean desirability score  it was 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to\xa02.2)  demonstrating that manuscript quality was a confounder. Authors were asked to\xa0add a citation to the reviewers work in 28 reviews (3%) but to others work in 98 (10%).

INPUT: The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme: are rheumatoid arthritis patients physically able to participate? The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme is a clinical and cost-effective programme for basic foot care in the elderly. The aim of this study was to determine if patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would be physically able to participate.  A consecutive cohort of RA patients undergoing podiatry care underwent tests for sight  reach and grip strength to determine their physical ability to undertake self-managed foot care.  Thirty RA patients (10 male  20 female)  with a median age of 61 years (range 42 to 84) and disease duration of 10 years (range one to 40)  were recruited. All patients passed the sight test  whereas the reach and grip tests were passed by 77% and 67% of patients  respectively. Only 57% of patients passed all the physical tests. Patients who failed the physical tests were older  and had longer disease duration and higher physical disability  pain and general health scores but these were not statistically different.

INPUT: Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies? To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/  A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n\xa0=\xa040)  sham acupuncture (n\xa0=\xa044)  or no treatment (n\xa0=\xa039) for 6\xa0weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30\xa0minutes  two times a week for 6\xa0weeks  whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture\xa0=\xa040; sham acupuncture\xa0=\xa043; and no treatment\xa0=\xa034)  but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture\xa0=\xa029; sham acupuncture\xa0=\xa033;
