***TASK***
The task is to perform a semantic classification of the article according to the hallmarks of cancer based on its abstract.

***INPUT***
The input is an abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***
There are 10 cancer hallmarks you will need to decide whether the article is related to, including:
activating invasion and metastasis
sustaining proliferative signaling
resisting cell death
cellular energetics
genomic instability and mutation
evading growth suppressors
inducing angiogenesis
enabling replicative immortality
avoiding immune destruction
tumor promoting inflammation

***OUTPUT***
The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each class.
Put value 1 if the article is related to that class, 0 if the article is not related to that class. 
Please note one article can be related to multiple classes.
Example output:
{
  "activating invasion and metastasis": ,
  "sustaining proliferative signaling": ,
  "resisting cell death": ,
  "cellular energetics": ,
  "genomic instability and mutation": ,
  "evading growth suppressors": ,
  "inducing angiogenesis": ,
  "enabling replicative immortality": ,
  "avoiding immune destruction": ,
  "tumor promoting inflammation": 
}
